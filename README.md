# create-multislice-imgs
Python script for creating fMRI images with mricroGL automatically. 

This script was designed to automaize the process on creating fMRI reports.
In the report we show images of DTI mapping - a 3D mapping.
The script is designed to run a visualization program (mricroGL), submit all the right params and create a folder with all the requiered images.

Script is design with parameters that suited the MRI scan we worked with and the slices we wished to show in the report.
